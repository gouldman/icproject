Sequential clock pins with multiple clock waveforms

The following sequential clock pins have multiple clock waveforms from a single 
timing mode driving them.  Timing analysis will use all of the waveforms to     
determine the most pessimistic timing constraints.  The pin attribute           
'propagated_clocks' can be used to analyze which clocks are being used at each  
clock pin.

Nets with multiple drivers

The following nets have multiple drivers and at least one of the drivers is     
non-tristate:

Timing exceptions with no effect

The following timing exceptions are not currently affecting timing in the       
design.  Either no paths in the design satisfy the exception's path             
specification, or all paths that satisfy the path specification also satisfy an 
exception with a higher priority.  You can improve runtime and memory usage by  
removing these exceptions if they are not truly needed.  To see if there is a   
path in the design that satisfies the path specification for an exception, or   
to see what other exception is overriding an exception because of priority, use 
the command:

Inputs without external driver/transition

The following primary inputs have no external driver or input transition set.   
As a result the transition on the ports will be assumed as zero. The            
'external_driver' attribute is used to add and external driver or the           
'fixed_slew' attribute to add an external transition.
