  1 Warning CDFG-217    Signal or variable has multiple drivers and no     
                        loads. This may cause verification mismatches      
                        between the original and synthesized designs.      
                        Verify that the drivers of this signal are         
                        correct.                                           
385   Info  CDFG-250    Processing multi-dimensional arrays.               
  6   Info  CDFG-361    Signal is not referenced within the process or     
                        block, but is in the sensitivity list.             
                        Asynchronous logic, such as a latch or             
                        combinational logic, is inferred for this process  
                        or block. Signals that are not referenced can be   
                        removed from the sensitivity list. If the intent   
                        is to infer a flip-flop, ensure that the process   
                        or block is sensitive to the signal edge by        
                        adding 'posedge' or 'negedge' for Verilog designs  
                        or 'event' for VHDL designs.

                        sensitivity signal is in the sensitivity list.     
  4 Warning CDFG-368    Generated logic differs from the expected logic.   
                        The logic generated for an always_comb,            
                        always_latch or always_ff process may not match    
                        the specified behavior.                            
  1 Warning CDFG-428    Creating blackbox.                                 
                        Blackboxes are represented as unresolved           
                        references in the design. Use                      
                        '::legacy::set_attribute hdl_error_on_blackbox

                        found.                                             
  2 Warning CDFG-468    Output port is wider than connected signal.        
                        This may cause simulation mismatches between the   
                        original and synthesized designs.

  1 Warning TUI-273     Black-boxes are represented as unresolved          
                        references in the design.                          
                        To resolve the reference, either load a            
                        technology library containing the cell by          
                        appending to the 'library' attribute, or read in

                        incomplete, synthesis results may not correspond
